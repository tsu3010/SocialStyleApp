Social Style Finder App
Overview
The Social Style Finder App is a simple, interactive web application designed to help users determine their social style based on a short questionnaire. As users input their responses in real-time, the application dynamically calculates and displays their perceived social style on an interactive matrix.

Features
Interactive Questionnaire: A series of questions designed to capture verbal and non-verbal behavioral preferences.

Real-time Style Calculation: Your social style is updated instantly as you select answers.

Dynamic Matrix Visualization: A visual matrix displays your calculated style with a moving indicator, showing where you fall within the four social styles (Analytical, Driver, Amiable, Expressive).

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be usable on various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Clear Selection Highlight: Selected radio button options are highlighted for better user experience.

Social Styles Explained (from the questionnaire)
The app categorizes social styles into four quadrants based on two dimensions:

Assertiveness (Tell/Ask): How directly you express your thoughts and feelings.

Tell (A, B): More direct, makes statements, takes charge, competitive, outgoing.

Ask (C, D): More indirect, asks questions, goes along, cooperative, reserved.

Responsiveness (Task/People): How openly you express emotions and focus on relationships versus tasks.

Task (1, 2): More controlled, private, calm, task-oriented, objective, does not express emotion.

People (3, 4): More emotional, warm, excitable, people-oriented, personal, expresses emotion.

The four resulting social styles are:

Analytical: (Ask, Task) - Characterized by being quiet, calm, task-oriented, and factual.

Driver: (Tell, Task) - Characterized by being talkative, excitable, challenging, and dominant.

Amiable: (Ask, People) - Characterized by being supportive, cooperative, reserved, and warm.

Expressive: (Tell, People) - Characterized by being outgoing, enthusiastic, and sharing personal feelings.

Important Note: There are no "right" or "wrong" styles. The effectiveness of a style depends on the communication context. Individuals can learn to adapt their styles and may flex between categories.

How to Set Up and Use
This application is a single HTML file, making it incredibly easy to set up and run.

Save the Code:

Copy the entire HTML code provided in the Canvas (from <!DOCTYPE html> to </html>).

Paste it into a plain text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code, Sublime Text).

Save as HTML File:

Save the file with an .html extension (e.g., social_style_finder.html).

Ensure that when saving, the "Save as type" or "Format" option is set to "All Files" or "Plain Text" to prevent the editor from adding an unwanted .txt extension.

Open in Browser:

Navigate to the location where you saved the social_style_finder.html file on your computer.

Double-click the file. It will automatically open in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

Using the App:

Once the app is open in your browser, simply go through the questionnaire.

Select the radio button that best describes you for each pair of descriptors.

Observe the "Your Social Style" section at the bottom of the page. Your calculated "Highest Letter," "Highest Number," and "Your Style" will update in real-time.

The blue indicator dot on the Social Style Matrix will also move dynamically to show your current style quadrant.

Enjoy discovering your social style!# SocialStyleApp
